In the near future, I want to completely connect my life with programming. I'm ready to do everything that is required of me to achieve my goal. I approach my tasks responsibility and always try to complete them on time.

---
I am learning programming languages like:
* *C++* 
* *JavaScript*

In the near future, I plan to completely connect my life with this activity.
During my studies at the university, I managed to learn **OpenGL** and **SFML**, at the moment I am studying Front-End development.

### As an example of code, I want to give a piece from my term paper ###

```
void GameState::HandleInput()
	{
		sf::Event event;
		while (this->_data->window.pollEvent(event))
		{
			if (sf::Event::Closed == event.type)
			{
				this->_data->window.close();
			}
			if (this->_data->input.IsSpriteClicked(this->_pauseButton, sf::Mouse::Left, this->_data->window))
			{
				this->_data->machine.AddState(StateRef(new PauseState(_data)), false);
			}
			else if (this->_data->input.IsSpriteClicked(this->_gridSprite, sf::Mouse::Left, this->_data->window))
			{
				if (STATE_PLAYING == gameState)
				{
					this->CheckAndPlacePiece();
				}
			}
		}
	}
